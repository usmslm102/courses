# Azure App Service with Docker Compose: Full-Stack React & Node.js Deployment

In this video, I walk you through the process of deploying a full-stack application with a React frontend and an Express.js backend API to Azure App Service using Docker Compose. I cover the steps required to build and containerize both the frontend and backend, configure Docker Compose for a seamless deployment, and deploy the application to Azure. This guide is perfect for developers looking to leverage Azure's powerful cloud services for their full-stack applications.
